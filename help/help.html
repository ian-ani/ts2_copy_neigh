		<h1>HELP</h1>
		
			<p>This software has been created to be used with <b>The Sims 2</b> to be able to have a copy of a neighborhood of your choice.  
			It is recommended to read <b>this Help file fully</b> before using this software and 
			to have a backup of your directory of choice.</p>
		
			<h2>SOURCE PATH</h2>
		
				<h3>INSTALLATION NEIGHBORHOODS</h3>
					
					<p>If you want to copy a clean neighborhood (non-played neighborhoods) from base game, the available directories are the following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>N001</b> corresponds to <b>Pleasantview</b></li>
							<li><b>N002</b> corresponds to <b>Strangetown</b></li>
							<li><b>N003</b> corresponds to <b>Veronaville</b></li>
							<li><b>Tutorial</b></li>
						</ul>
			
					<p>Its path will be something similar to this one: 
					<i>\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection\Double Deluxe\Base\TSData\Res\UserData\Neighborhoods\</i><b>[neighborhood code]</b></p>
			
					<p>If you want to copy clean neighborhoods from an expansion pack:</p>
			
						<ul>
							<li><b>G001</b> corresponds to <b>Riverblossom Hills (The Sims 2: Seasons)</b></li>
							<li><b>F001</b> corresponds to <b>Desiderata Valley (The Sims 2: FreeTime)</b></li>
							<li><b>E001</b> corresponds to <b>Belladonna Cove (The Sims 2: Apartment Life)</b></li>
						</ul>
			
					<p>Its path will be something similar to these:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>G001</b>: <i>\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection\Seasons\TSData\Res\UserData\Neighborhoods\</i><b>G001</b></li>
							<li><b>F001</b>: <i>\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection\Free Time\TSData\Res\UserData\Neighborhoods\</i><b>F001</b></li>
							<li><b>E001</b>: <i>\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection\Apartment Life\TSData\Res\UserData\Neighborhoods\</i><b>E001</b></li>
						</ul>
			
				<h3>PLAYED NEIGHBORHOODS</h3>
			
					<p>If what you want is to copy a played neighborhood or a custom neighborhood, its default path is the following:</p>
			
					<p>[Drive]<i>:\Users\</i>[your username]<i>\Documents\EA Games\The Sims™ 2 Ultimate Collection\Neighborhoods\</i><b>[neighborhood code]</b></p>
			
			<h2>DESTINATION PATH</h2>
		
				<p>What I recommend for easily incrementing the code number from the folder is that the destination path should be as follows:</p>
			
				<p>[Drive]<i>:\Users\</i>[your username]<i>\Documents\EA Games\The Sims™ 2 Ultimate Collection\Neighborhoods</i></p>
			
			<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
			
				<p>If you want to copy Pleasantview (neighborhood with code N001) its source path will be:
				<i>\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection\Double Deluxe\Base\TSData\Res\UserData\Neighborhoods\</i><b>N001</b></p>
				
				<p>But once you have to choose its destination path you <b>MUST NOT</b> choose a neighborhood code: 
				[Drive]<i>:\Users\</i>[your username]<i>\Documents\EA Games\The Sims™ 2 Ultimate Collection\Neighborhoods</i></p>
